<td>Scientific and Technical (Scientific and Engineering Award)</td>
<td>To MARK NOEL for the design, engineering, and development, and to JOHN FRAZIER for his contributions to the design and safety features, of the NAC Servo Winch System. The NAC System allows full-size cars, aircraft and other heavy props to be flown on wires with unprecedented freedom of motion and a high degree of safety, on-set and in real time. The intuitive control system responds to the motion of the operator's hand, permitting the recording and playback of all axes of motion simultaneously, which may be edited and refined for playback in subsequent takes.
